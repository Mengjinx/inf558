Tibetan Mastiffs eat much less than expected for their size, as adults may only require two to four cups of a quality food per day. They only eat when they are hungry, and it is not uncommon for a TM to skip a meal altogether. When females are in season, males will often refuse to eat for a week or more and can lose as much as 10 to 15 percent of their body weight. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\u2019s weight or diet.
