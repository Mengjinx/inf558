They do like to please, but they\u2019re also independent thinkers. They tend to be calm but inquisitive, devoted but not fawning, self-assured but not overly trusting of strangers. They get along fairly well with other dogs and pets. They are alert watchdogs in the home and will alert their family to visitors or strangers, however they are typically not excessive barkers.
